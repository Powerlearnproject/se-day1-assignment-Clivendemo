Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
This is the process of designing, building, testing and maintaining software applications.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

1. The transition from low-level programming languages to high-level programming languages which makes coding easier.
2. The emergence of digital computers which led to the need for structred programming approach which is flexible and responds to changes.
3. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Problem recognition - This is where the programmer identifies a problem in the environment and seeks to solve it by writing or creating a program.
2. Problem Definition - This is the gathering of the likely input, processing activities and expected output.
3. Program Design - Creating detailed designs of the software and the user interface.
4. Program Coding - This is the actual process of converting an algorithm into an executable program by writing a code.
5. Program Testing - Testing the program in order to correct any errors.
6. Program Deployment and Maintenance - This is where the software is released to users. Ongoing support is provided through regular updates and improvements which comprises maintenance.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In waterfall methods, the development process emphasizes completing one phase before proceeding to the next phase while agile is an iterative and incremental approach whereby each version is improved until the full system is implemented.
The waterfall method is best used in systems that have well-defined requirements like banking systems or government projects while agile is suitable in mobile apps which are customer-centred and require frequent updates depending on customer feedback or competition.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer -  Is responsible for coding and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer - Organises software testing plans to ensure software quality.
Project Manager - Is the overall supervisor of the software project. He oversees the planning execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
An IDE is a software application that provides tools for writing, debugging and testing code in a single interface e.g. Visual Studio while VCS is a tool that helps track any changes in code, allowing multiple developers to collaborate efficiently e.g. Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Tight deadlines
2. Technical debts
3. Changing requirements during the development.

Overcoming the challenges
1. Effective communication
2. Use of agile methodologies
3. Prioritizing of tasks
4. Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines
   
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing - this focuses on testing individual components of code separately.
2. integration testing - This verifies that different modules or services work together correctly. That is testing a particular function in a system.
3. System Testing - It evaluates the entire system as a whole to verify if it meets functional requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing - This determines whether software meets business requirements and if it is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
This is the process of designing and refining prompts to effectively communicate with AI models and get the desired output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt
Make a program that processes data
Improved version
Create a Python program that reads a CSV file containing sales data, calculates total revenue per product, and generates a summary report in a new CSV file
